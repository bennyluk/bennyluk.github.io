    -   title: Ease of Use
        description: Our old <a href="/site-editor">website builder</a> had a major issue - clients were canceling after just 10 minutes due to its complexity. Using data analytics and customer support, we simplified the UI/UX and focused on key features to make it easier for everyone.
    -   title: Site Performance
        description: Google Page Speed now considers site performance when measuring SEO. To address this, we wrote our live site in native JavaScript without dependencies and optimized our CSS to prevent unnecessary loading. <a href="https://pagespeed.web.dev/report?url=https%3A%2F%2Ftemplatedemo.website.com%2Flanding-page" target="_blank">View real performance test.</a>
    -   title: Optimizing Server
